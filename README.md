# STAH_ML_MODEL

## Overview

This project is an ML-driven platform developed to detect early signs of mental health issues and offer timely interventions or resources for promoting mental well-being.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a platform that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of mental health concerns based on user-provided information.

## Features

- **User Input:** Users can input their details, including gender, age, academic information, and anxiety-related responses.
  
- **Prediction:** The platform employs machine learning models trained on a dataset to predict the likelihood of mental health concerns based on user inputs.

- **Model Ensemble:** Multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, CatBoost) are used to enhance prediction accuracy.)

## Implementation Details

- **Algorithms and Models:** RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, and CatBoost models are employed for prediction. Models are trained on the dataset to predict mental health concerns based on user inputs.

- **Evaluation:** Model predictions are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing real-time user interaction for continuous assessment and monitoring.
- Integrating additional features for more accurate predictions.
- Enhancing the user interface for better accessibility and user experience.

## Conclusion

This project aims to contribute to mental health awareness by leveraging AI and machine learning techniques. By detecting early signs of mental health issues and providing timely interventions or resources, the platform strives to promote mental well-being among users.
